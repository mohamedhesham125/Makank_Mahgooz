# 📍 Makank_Mahgooz

## About the Project
Makank_Mahgooz is an Android application I built to practice and apply modern Android development concepts while solving a real-world problem: organizing and managing place reservations.

The idea came from the common issue of waiting times and unorganized bookings in places like cafés, restaurants, and service locations. The app provides a simple way for users to browse places and make reservations through a clean and easy-to-use interface.


## What the App Does
- Allows users to browse available places
- Make reservations in a few simple steps
- View and manage their bookings
- Navigate smoothly between screens


## My Role
I developed this project **as an Android Developer**, and I handled:
- Building the entire Android app
- Creating UI screens using **Jetpack Compose**
- Applying **MVVM architecture**
- Managing state and navigation
- Handling basic backend integration
- Improving performance and UI responsiveness
- Adding Maps Services for the Application


## Tech Stack

### Android
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose

- REST APIs
- JSON


## Performance Considerations
While building the app, I focused on:
- Using `LazyColumn` and `LazyRow` for lists
- Keeping recompositions to a minimum
- Separating UI from business logic
- Writing clean and readable code
- Handling loading and error states properly
